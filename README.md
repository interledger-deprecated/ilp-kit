`CLIENT_TITLE` | `ILP Kit` | Browser title and logo

##### Default five-bells-ledger environment variables 
(used if the `API_LEDGER_URI` is not specified). You can read more about these variables in the [five-bells-ledger readme](https://github.com/interledgerjs/five-bells-ledger#step-3-run-it).

Name | Default |
---- | ------- |
`LEDGER_DB_URI` | `DB_URI`
`LEDGER_ADMIN_USER` | `API_LEDGER_ADMIN_USER`
`LEDGER_ADMIN_PASS` | `API_LEDGER_ADMIN_PASS`

`LEDGER_PUBLIC_PORT` | `CLIENT_PORT`
`LEDGER_PUBLIC_PATH` | `ledger`
`LEDGER_CURRENCY_CODE` | `USD`
`LEDGER_CURRENCY_SYMBOL` | `$`

## Advanced Mode
ILP kit UI comes with an "advanced mode" for developers and advanced users. You can activate it with a hot-key: `option+d` on Mac or `alt+d` on Windows. 

## Architecture
ILP kit consists of:
* a connector
* a Five Bells ledger
* a [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) (developed on v7.7.1) backend (REST API)
* a proxy in front of that API, known as the 'wallet'.
* a client built using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).

### Backend (REST API)
The backend is responsible for communicating with the ILP ledger, creating accounts, sending payments and keeping the payment history.

#### API docs
[https://interledgerjs.github.io/ilp-kit/apidoc](https://interledgerjs.github.io/ilp-kit/apidoc/)

#### How it works

The wallet implements [SPSP](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/master/0009-simple-payment-setup-protocol/0009-simple-payment-setup-protocol.md) for initiating and receiving payments.

This means it announces an SPSP address of the form `user@host`, and links this to two things:
* an ILP address (roughly of the form `g.us.usd.host.user`, but this is not enforced, and your ILP address is not a unique string)
* a cryptographic key pair, used indirectly to generate and fulfill crypto conditions.

The connector component can peer with other connectors on the Interledger, and basically acts as a router.

The ledger can handle payments that are conditional on a cryptographic condition, and that's where the power of ILP lies.
When you send money to an account on another ledger, your connector conditionally pays the next connector, all the way to the receiving connector.
The receiving connector adds a conditional payment to the receiving ledger, and the receiver (which lives in the API component) fulfills the
crypto condition, using (a key which from) the receiver's public key.

Only the receiver of an Interledger payment can fulfill the crypto condition, and that's why you can be sure that the intermediate hops will all
roll back if the money cannot be safely delivered.

##### Webfinger
Webfinger is used to lookup account/user identifiers.

Example request 
```bash
curl -X GET
https://wallet.example/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:alice@wallet.example
```

Example response 
```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{
  "subject": "acct:alice@red.ilpdemo.org",
  "links": [
    {
      "rel": "https://interledger.org/rel/ledgerUri",
      "href": "https://red.ilpdemo.org/ledger"
    },
    {
      "rel": "https://interledger.org/rel/socketIOUri",
      "href": "https://red.ilpdemo.org/api/socket.io"
    },
    {
      "rel": "https://interledger.org/rel/ledgerAccount",
      "href": "https://red.ilpdemo.org/ledger/accounts/alice"
    },
    {
      "rel": "https://interledger.org/rel/sender/payment",
      "href": "https://red.ilpdemo.org/api/payments"
    },
    {
      "rel": "https://interledger.org/rel/sender/pathfind",
      "href": "https://red.ilpdemo.org/api/payments/findPath"
    },
    {
      "rel": "https://interledger.org/rel/spsp/v2",
      "href": "https://red.ilpdemo.org/api/spsp/alice"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Client
The client is a web app built on [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) that implements user signup/signin, sending payments and payment history.

Client state management is handled by [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux).

#### Theme Customization

`npm install` generates a `src/theme/variables.scss` which contains the theme colors. You can manually edit it.

Database has two tables: Users and Payments.
